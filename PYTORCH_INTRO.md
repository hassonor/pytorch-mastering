#### What is PyTorch?
* Most popular research deep learning framework.
* Write fast deep learning code in Python (able to run on a GPY/many GPUs)
* Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub/ torchvision.models)
* Whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud
* Originally designed and used in-house by Facebook/Meta (now open-source and used by companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI).

#### What is GPU/TPU?
* **GPU** (Graphics Processing Unit)
* **TPU** (Tensor Processing Unit)
