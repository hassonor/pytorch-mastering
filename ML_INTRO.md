#### What Deep Learning is good for
* **Problems with long lists of rules** - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.
* **Continually changing environments** - deep learning can adapt('learn') to new scenarios.
* **Discovering insights within large collections of data** - can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?

#### What Deep Learning Typically is NOT good for:
* **When you need explainability** - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
* **When the traditional approach is a better option** - if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
* **When errors are unacceptable** - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable.
* **When you don't have much data** - deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results.


### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning - Common algorithms

* **Depending on** how you represent your problem, many algorithms can be used for both.

* Structured Data:
  * Random forest
  * Gradient boosted models
  * Naive Bayes
  * Nearest neighbour
  * Support vector machine
  * ...many more
* Unstructured Data:
  * Neural networks
  * Fully connected neural network
  * Convolutional neural network
  * Recurrent neural network
  * Transformer
  * ...many more
  * In PyTorch, we are focusing in: Neural networks, Fully connected neural network and Convolutional neural network.

#### Types of Learning
* **Supervised Learning**
* **Unsupervised & Self-supervised Learning**
* **Transfer Learning**
